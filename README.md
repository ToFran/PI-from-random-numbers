# Unusual way to generate π: Generating Pi from random numbers

The purpose of this repo is to gather (programming) solutions for the peculiar procedure for generating / achieving [π (Pi)][Pi] that [Matt Parker] presented in [this video][Video].

## Why
1. In commemoration for the 2017 [Pi Day].
2. Having fun.
3. No apparent logic reason.

## How does it work
Since the **Probability of Two (random) Integers Being [Coprime][Coprime integers]** is given by:

![formula 1](https://i.imgur.com/TZt9nAX.gif "x = \frac{6}{\pi^{2}}") [Proof and demonstration]

We can generate lots of numbers and calculate π by:

![formula 2](http://i.imgur.com/5Ksi47K.gif "\pi = \sqrt{\frac{6}{x}}")

Watch Matt Parker generating π from 1,000 random numbers by rolling a dice on [here][Video full].

## Aknologments
All solutions are from these users (in no particular order), some are quite efficient others not so much. Regardless thanks very much.
