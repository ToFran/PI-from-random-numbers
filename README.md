# Unusual way to generate π: Generating Pi from random numbers

## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to gather (programming) solutions for the peculiar procedure for generating / achieving [π (Pi)][Pi] that **Matt Parker** presented.

## Why
1. In commemoration for the 2017 [Pi Day][Pi Day].
2. Having fun.
3. No apparent logic reason.

## How does it work
Since the **Probability of Two (random) Integers Being [Coprime][Coprime integers]** is given by: 
![formula 1](https://i.imgur.com/TZt9nAX.gif "x = \frac{6}{\pi^{2}}") [Proof and demonstration]

We can generate lots of numbers and calculate π by:
